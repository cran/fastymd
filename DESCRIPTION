Description: A collection of utility functions for working with
  Year Month Day objects. Includes functions for fast parsing of numeric
  and character input based on algorithms described in Hinnant, H. (2021) 
  <https://howardhinnant.github.io/date_algorithms.html> as well as a branchless
  calculation of leap years by Jerichaux (2025) <https://stackoverflow.com/a/79564914>.
